        <h1 id='Fulltitle'>FULLSTACK PROGRAMMING:</h1>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">At just 14 years old, I decided to enter a world that few people my age chose to explore, embarking on a journey to improve my knowledge as a FullStack Developer. What began as a simple curiosity soon turned into an exciting journey, full of learning, challenges and achievements. I've always shown my passion for technology since my early teens. Fascinated by the way codes intertwine to create the digital wonders we use every day, I decided it was time to uncover the secrets behind the scenes.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">My first step on this journey was to learn the essential programming languages. With an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I devoured online tutorials, documentation and specialized courses. Python and JavaScript became my companions, and little by little I began to understand the Frontend and Backend. I remember the first lines of code I wrote. The thrill of seeing something come to life on my computer screen was indescribable. Every challenge overcome, every bug fixed were small victories that fueled my passion and drove me forward.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">As I delved deeper into the tech stack, I realized the importance of acquiring diverse skills. HTML, CSS and JavaScript became the fundamental pillars of my front-end learning, while Node.js and Express introduced me to the complex universe of the back-end. The database has been my faithful ally, I'm not 100% yet, but I've got a good handle on it.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">My journey has had its difficult moments. I faced many hours of frustration in the face of complicated problems, but I realized that every obstacle was a chance in disguise. Every mistake, every faulty line of code, represented a valuable lesson that brought me closer to mastering FullStack development. As well as technical learning, I understood the importance of the community in my career. Online forums, developer groups and collaborative platforms became my partners. Sharing experiences, asking for help and offering support to other aspiring developers were crucial elements in my growth.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">Now 14 years old, I see no limitations to what I can achieve. My journey as a FullStack developer is just the beginning of an exciting path. Looking forward to the future, I'm prepared to take on even greater challenges, contribute to innovative projects and continue learning, evolving and motivating others to follow the path of technology. The sky's the limit and I can't wait to explore the countless opportunities offered by the world of web development.</h3>

        <h1 id="GamerDev">GAME DEVELOPMENT:</h1>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">With 15y, I took an even bigger leap towards my love of technology by diving headfirst into the exciting world of game development. Combining my passion for creating software with my fascination for the gaming universe, I embarked on a dual journey as a FullStack and Gamer Developer, determined to explore all aspects of this vast field.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">It was a natural transition, fueled by the desire to create interactive experiences that captivate and engage players. With a solid foundation in programming acquired during my first year exploring web development, I took my first steps into Game Development, immersing myself in engines such as Unity (and Unreal, but I don't use it with frequency as Unity).</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">I remember the first lines of code I wrote to create a simple 2D game. The feeling of seeing my characters and settings come to life on the screen was electrifying, and I knew I had found my true passion. Each line of code became a new piece of the puzzle, each function and algorithm were like brushstrokes on a blank canvas, shaping imaginary worlds before my eyes. Over time, I've honed my skills in programming and game design. I learned the art of creating engaging game mechanics, the importance of narrative and level design, and the complexity behind optimizing performance to ensure a smooth and immersive experience.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">But my journey wasn't just about creating exciting games; it was also about understanding the balance between creativity and technique. As a FullStack Developer, I was able to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks such as React to create websites and applications to complement my games. This fusion of skills allowed me to create connected gaming experiences, with multiplayer integration and community features.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">Throughout this journey, I've encountered challenges and obstacles, but each one has been an opportunity for growth. I've learned the importance of perseverance, problem-solving and collaborating with other developers. Sharing experiences, exchanging ideas and receiving feedback have been crucial aspects of my personal and professional development. Over time, I've honed my skills in programming and game design. I learned the art of creating engaging game mechanics, the importance of narrative and level design, and the complexity behind optimizing performance to ensure a smooth and immersive experience.</h3>

        <h3 id="Fulldesc">Now with 13 years, I join into Hacking Experience. Fascinated by the idea of exploring the limits of technology and uncovering its deepest secrets, I began a journey that would take me to new heights as a Full Stack Developer, Game Creator and Hacker.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">My entry into the world of hacking was not motivated by malice, but by an insatiable curiosity and a burning desire to understand how things work. I began by exploring the fundamentals of cyber security, learning about networks, operating systems and communication protocols. I quickly found myself immersed in a world of exploits, vulnerabilities and hacking techniques.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">Combining my programming skills with my newfound knowledge of hacking, I began to explore new horizons in FullStack development and Game creation. While continuing to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other languages, I also applied my knowledge of hacking to better understand systems and find ways to strengthen their security.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">My hacking experience brought a new dimension to my journey as a Game Developer and Creator. By understanding vulnerabilities and potential threats, I was able to design more robust systems and more secure games. In addition, my hacking experience has allowed me to explore new forms of interactivity and game mechanics, challenging conventional boundaries and creating unique experiences for players.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">However, my journey as a hacker was not without its challenges and responsibilities. As I delved deeper into this world, I realized the importance of using my skills ethically and responsibly. Instead of exploiting systems for malicious reasons, I focused on contributing to cybersecurity by identifying vulnerabilities and helping to strengthen digital infrastructure.</h3>
        <h3 id="Fulldesc">Over the years, I've learned valuable lessons about ethics, responsibility and the power of technology to shape the world around us. My journey as a Full Stack developer, game creator and hacker has been a rollercoaster of emotions, challenges and achievements.
